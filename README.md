# CppResources
Resources for learning C++!

Hi all,

I’m gonna try and send this to some of the 8th graders we talked to last week as well, so I've included some more formal introductions. My name is George and I am in charge of a lot of the programming for the high school robotics team. If you aren’t interested in programming you can just ignore this. Last week some of the 8th graders asked for some resources to get started programming in C++ (which we will be using for the robot again next year) but I didn’t have anything. So as not to leave them empty-handed I thought I'd make a "little” list. As you can see, it got a little out of hand, so please don’t be overwhelmed. To be clear this isn’t any sort of “required” summer assignment, just some links in case you're interested. 
That being said, if you don’t have any experience programming, I can’t recommend learning in the middle of the robotics season. There is simply too much to do, and too little time. Hopefully, next year will be better since I’m no longer the only one with experience programming a robot, but it can still be a lot to learn at once. It may be more rewarding to devote more time to other aspects of the robot while developing programming skills for future years. And know that if you aren’t able to participate in programming in any given year it is not a reflection of your ability to contribute in the future. It just means that you didn’t have some esoteric knowledge coming in. On a similar note, if you weren’t able to contribute much to programing in previous years feel free to give it a second chance. I’ll likely have more time and do a better job explaining next year (hopefully). So if you're up for the challenge, great! I recommend you at least take a look at some of the links below to get a head start. The more of the boring language stuff you know coming in, the more time we can spend on the robot!

## Editors:
If you are going to write code, you’ll need a place to run it. Unfortunately this can end up being a larger challenge than the programming itself and differs from platform to platform. If you don’t have much experience, I’d recommend starting by playing around in an online editors. I will typically use a local IDE like CLion, Code::Blocks, Xcode, or VSCode. And while it is annoying and difficult, it can be helpful to learn to manually edit and compile from the command line.

 - http://cpp.sh (Online)

## Tutorials:
For actually learning the language, you can find countless tutorial online. Here are a few that I will often go back to when I forget how to do something or need to clarify a concept, but use whatever makes the most sense to you.
 - https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/default.asp (Recommended)
 - https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ (Personal preference)
 - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm (Another good option)

## Practice:
While tutorials are useful, you only really learn by doing. I’ve made a list of some places that will have "practice problems", but those can become tedious and boring. If you can find a project of your own it can be more engaging, and could create something actually useful. You might try to recreate Worldle, of make a thing to do your math homework.
 - https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/cpp_exercises.asp (Follows along with the above tutorial)
 - https://edabit.com/challenges (Lots of challenge problems on different subjects)
 - https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/examples (Practice problems and tutorials)

## Reference:
When I forget what the name of a function is, these are usually the places I go. Well actually I google it, but google usually brings me to one of these. Also feel free to ask me anything, and I'll be helpful to help to the best of my ability. And since I often misjudge the complexity of various concepts, it's useful to hear what we should spend more time on during the pre-season.

- https://google.com (Google)

## WPILib (The FRC library):
A lot of the programing for robotics is less writing original code, and instead leveraging the code that FRC has already made for us. It would be difficult to do anything without having a robot, but if you're interested they have good tutorials explaining the library and concepts behind it.
 - https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/index.html (Tutorials etc.)
 - https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html (Reference)


## Unix:
A lot of the programing world is built on a base of a Unix operating system (particularly in C and C++). Having a foundational understanding is certainly not necessary, but is something that can be helpful (particularly if you try and compile manually).
 - https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-command-line-basics (Command line basics)
 - http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~rhainin1/walkthroughs/gccbasics.html (C compiler basics)
 - to learn Vim (a command line text editor) just type `vimtutor` into the terminal. (Text editor)
 - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/index.htm (Unix overview)
 - http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/ (Unix Overview)

	Now that I’ve thrown a bunch of like at you I have to suggest that you ignore most of them. Try to get to the actual programing part as fast as you can otherwise you’ll get bogged down into boring conceptual details and loose any enthusiasm. See how far you can get in a webpage. You'll outgrow it, but it will make sure you don’t get stuck trying to install the right version of a command line tool you don’t actually understand as I have so often done. Anyway, as with most thing I write this has become incomprehensibly convoluted. Hopefully one of you was able to get something out of it though.I wish you all a great summer and I hope to see you next year in robotics.

Please feel free to reach out for any clarification of this hot mess,
George Jurgiel
