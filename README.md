Hi all,

This only really pertains to programming, so if your not intrested in that you can ignore this. Also, I’m gonna try and send this to some of the 8th graders we talked to a few weeks ago as well, so I've included some more formal introductions. 

My name is George, and along with Aiden, we are in charge of programming for the high school robotics team. Last week some of the 8th graders asked for some resources to get started programming in C++, which will be used on the robot next year, but I didn’t have anything. So as not to leave them empty-handed, I thought I'd make a "little” list. To be clear, this isn’t a “required” summer assignment.

That being said, if you don’t have any experience programming, I can’t recommend learning in the middle of the robotics season. There is simply too much to do, and too little time. 

Although next year I should have more time to teach new members, it is a lot of material to cover in a short duration. It may be more rewarding to devote time to other aspects of the robot such as mechanical or electrical while developing programming skills for future years. Additionally, if you aren’t able to participate in programming one year, it does not mean you are not able to contribute in the next. But if you're up for the challenge, great! I recommend you at least take a look at some of the links below to get a head start. The more of the boring language stuff you know coming in, the more time we can spend on the robot!

You can find a list fo reasources here on out git repository: https://github.com/rambunction4330/CppResources. You can also find previouse years code. But Warning: It is a incomprehensable mess (as it always becomes in the end). You don't need to go through all of these links. Try to get to the actual programming part down rather than getting bogged down in boring conceptual details which will make you lose enthusiasm. See how far you can get on a webpage. You'll outgrow it, but it will make sure you don’t get stuck trying to install the right version of a command-line tool you don’t understand as I have so often done. I wish you all a great summer and I hope to see you next year in robotics.

Please feel free to reach out for any clarification,
George Jurgiel

# CppResources
Resources for learning C++!

## Editors:
If you are going to write code, you’ll need a place to run it. Unfortunately, this can end up being a larger challenge than the programming itself and differs from platform to platform. If you don’t have much experience, start by playing around in an online editor. I will typically use a local IDE like CLion, Code::Blocks, Xcode, or VSCode. And while it can be annoying and difficult, it is helpful to learn to manually edit and run code from the command line.
 - https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler (Online. And run multi-file programs)
 - http://cpp.sh (Online)

## Tutorials:
For actually learning the language, you can find countless tutorials online. Here are a few that I will often go back to when I forget how to do something or need to clarify a concept. Use the one that you like the most.
 - https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/default.asp (Recommended)
 - https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/ (Personal preference)
 - https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm (Another good option)

## Practice:
While tutorials are useful, you only really learn by doing. I’ve made a list of some places that will have "practice problems", but those can become extremely boring. If you can find a project of your own it can be more engaging and could create something useful. You might try to recreate Worldle or write a program to do your math homework.
 - https://www.w3schools.com/CPP/cpp_exercises.asp (Follows along with the above tutorial)
 - https://edabit.com/challenges (Lots of challenge problems on different subjects)
 - https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/examples (Practice problems and tutorials)
 - Build Blackjack or a similar card game (A fun project that Aiden recommends)

## Reference:
When I forget what the name of a function is, these are usually the places I go. Well actually I google it, but google usually brings me to one of these. Also, feel free to ask me anything. It is useful to know which topics are the most difficult so that not only can we help you, but also help others with these difficult concepts during pre-season.
 - https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ (Language reference)
- https://en.cppreference.com/w/ (Language reference)
- https://stackoverflow.com (Forum to ask questions)
- https://google.com (Google)
- and of course me (gjurgiel55@ladueschools.net) and Aiden (alambert29@ladueschools.net)

## WPILib (The FRC library):
A lot of the programming for robotics is less writing original code, and instead leveraging the code that FRC has already written for us. It would be difficult to do anything without having a robot, but if you're interested, they have good tutorials explaining the library and the concepts behind it.

 - https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html (Reference)


## Linux:
All of the computers on the robot run a version of the Linux operating system. Although this is not required, it can be useful to learn how to use Unix/Linux, especially from the command line, to debug programs running on these computers. Much like learning c++, the best way to learn Linux/Unix is to use it daily. If you are on a mac, try using the terminal regularly. These skills will transfer over to Linux/Unix. If you are on windows, you can look into WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or you can access a Linux machine on the cloud at https://gitpod.io.

 - to learn Vim (a command line text editor) just type `vimtutor` into the terminal. (Text editor)
