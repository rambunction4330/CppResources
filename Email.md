Hi all,

This only really only pertains to programming, so if you're not interested in that you can ignore this. Also, I’m going to try and send this to some of the 8th graders we talked to a few weeks ago as well, so I've included some more formal introductions. 

My name is George Jurgiel, and along with Aiden Lambert, am in charge of programming for the high school robotics team. Last week some of the 8th graders asked for some resources to get started programming in C++, which will be used on the robot next year, but I didn’t have anything. So, as not to leave them empty-handed, I thought I'd make a "little” list. To be clear, this isn’t a “required” summer assignment.

That being said, if you don’t have any experience programming, I can’t recommend learning in the middle of the robotics season. There is simply too much to do, and too little time. 

Although next year I should have more time to teach new members, it is a lot of material to cover in a short duration. It may be more rewarding to devote time to other aspects of the robot such as the mechanical or electrical side of things while developing programming skills for future years. Additionally, if you aren’t able to participate in programming one year, it does not mean you are not able to contribute in the next, but if you're up for the challenge, great! I recommend you at least take a look at some of the links below to get a head start. The more of the boring language stuff you know coming in, the more time we can spend on the robot! The more familiar you are with programming and C++, the easier it will be for us to help you learn the wpilib library during the (pre)season.

You can find a list fo reasources here on out git repository: https://github.com/rambunction4330/CppResources. You can also find previous years' code. But be warned: it is a incomprehensable mess (as it always becomes in the end). You don't need to go through all of these links. They are just there to get you started and provide a resource in case you are struggling or wanting to learn something. Try to get the actual programming part down rather than getting bogged down in minute language features/details which will make you lose enthusiasm. See how far you can get on a webpage. You'll outgrow it, but it will make sure you don’t get stuck trying to install the right version of a command-line tool you don’t understand as I have so often done. I wish you all a great summer and I hope to see you next year in robotics.

Please feel free to reach out for any clarification,
George Jurgiel (and Aiden Lambert)
